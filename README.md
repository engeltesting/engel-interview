# Engel interview pair programming - Instruction

<p>This session should simulate real working tasks as a software developer in ENGEL. 
Teamwork is crucial part of ENGEL workflow and very often we need to cooperate.</p>

<p>This session aims to find out the way how participant behaves, uses sources, 
communicates and how can react on inputs, think about different ways and approach 
during everyday programming tasks.</p>

<p>This code example is not a production code, but it reflects our daily work.</p>

<p>The goal is the way itself rather than the result.</p>

### Tasks to complete:
<ol>
<li>With your guide explore the code and the application <br><br></li>
<li>Wizard step titles are now all the same – find out and implement the way to display them correctly<br><br></li>
<li>Action buttons – in the last step there should be button save and close – implement displaying this button only for this step and make this button to close the wizard
	 <ul>Can we make other buttons also conditional?</ul><br></li>  
<li>In each step there is a simple form – we can see now, there are some validations 
- implement checking the validity when next button is clicked 
– if form not valid, do not allow transition to next step
<ul>How can we display validation error message everywhere?</ul><br></li>

<li>Fix styling problems
	<ul>Align close button to the right</ul><br></li>
<li>When user fills out the wizard data should be stored and displayed in the table
	<ul>Think about possible ways</ul>
	<ul>Implement one approach</ul></li>
</ol>
