# Engel interview - tester pair programming - Instruction

<p>This session should simulate real working tasks as a software developer in ENGEL. 
Teamwork is crucial part of ENGEL workflow and very often we need to cooperate.</p>

<p>This session aims to find out the way how participant behaves, uses sources, 
communicates and how can react on inputs, think about different ways and approach 
during everyday programming tasks.</p>

<p>This code example is not a production code, but it reflects our daily work.</p>

<p>The goal is the way itself rather than the result.</p>

### Tasks to complete:
<ol>
  <li>With your guide explore the code and the application</li>
  <br>
  <li>Try to figure out where Unit tests should be implemented
    <ul> - If so implement them</ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Start testing environment (cypress)</li>
  <br>
  <li>Create at least one e2e test</li>
  <br>
</ol>
